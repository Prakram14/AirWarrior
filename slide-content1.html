    <p style="padding: 10px; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">
        The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is a tandem-rotor helicopter
        originally developed by American rotorcraft company 
        Vertol and now manufactured by Boeing Defense, Space 
        & Security. The Chinook is a heavy-lift helicopter 
        that is among the heaviest lifting Western helicopters.The Chinook is a heavy-lift helicopter operated by the Indian Air Force (IAF). It is primarily used for the transport of troops, artillery, equipment, and cargo. Manufactured by Boeing, the CH-47F(I) Chinook is known for its tandem rotor design, which provides superior lift capabilities and operational versatility. The IAF inducted the first batch of Chinooks in 2019 to enhance its logistical and combat support operations, especially in high-altitude areas like the Himalayas. The helicopter is crucial for missions involving disaster relief, medical evacuation, and battlefield supply, significantly boosting the IAF's operational efficiency.
        The Indian Air Force (IAF) has significantly enhanced its operational capabilities with the induction of the CH-47F(I) Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. The decision to procure these helicopters was made as part of a $3 billion deal with Boeing, which also included the purchase of 22 Apache AH-64 attack helicopters. The Chinook contract alone is valued at approximately $1.1 billion.

        The CH-47F(I) Chinooks were officially inducted into the IAF in March 2019, with the first four units arriving at the Mundra port in Gujarat before being assembled and integrated at the IAF base in Chandigarh. These helicopters are tailored to meet India-specific requirements and are expected to replace the older Mi-26 and Mi-17 helicopters in the IAF's fleet.
        
        The Chinooks are multi-mission heavy-lift transport helicopters capable of carrying up to 10 tons of cargo, including troops, artillery guns, and light armored vehicles. They are designed for operations across diverse terrains, including high-altitude regions such as the Himalayas, making them ideal for military operations, disaster relief, medical evacuations, search and rescue missions, and parachute drop.
        
        Equipped with a fully integrated digital cockpit management system and advanced cargo-handling capabilities, the Chinooks are expected to significantly boost the IAF's humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) capabilities. Their induction also reflects the strengthening of defense ties between India and the United States, as part of broader efforts to modernize India's defense infrastructure.</p>
