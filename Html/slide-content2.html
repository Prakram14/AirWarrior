    <h1 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align: center;">MIL MI-17</h1>
    <p style="padding: 10px; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">
    The Mil Mi-17 is a Soviet-designed Russian military
        helicopter family introduced in 1975, continuing in production as of
         2021 at two factories, in Kazan and Ulan-Ude. It is known as the Mi-8M
          series in Russian service.
          The Mi-17 helicopter, also known as the Mi-8M series, is a robust, medium-lift transport helicopter that has been an integral part of the Indian Air Force (IAF) since its induction. Originating from the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant and produced by Kazan Helicopters in Russia, the Mi-17 is an upgraded variant of the Mi-8, designed to meet the diverse operational requirements of modern military forces. The IAF operates several versions of the Mi-17, including the advanced Mi-17V-5, which has enhanced its strategic and tactical capabilities significantly.

          The design of the Mi-17 combines ruggedness with versatility. It features a powerful twin-engine setup, typically with two Klimov TV3-117VM or VK-2500 turboshaft engines, providing exceptional performance in various environments, including high-altitude terrains and hot climates. The helicopter's airframe is robust, allowing it to withstand harsh conditions and operate in challenging environments. The Mi-17 is equipped with advanced avionics, including a modern glass cockpit, weather radar, and autopilot systems, enhancing its operational efficiency and safety.
          
          One of the Mi-17's standout features is its impressive payload capacity. The helicopter can carry up to 36 troops or 4,000 kilograms of internal cargo. For external loads, it can lift up to 4,500 kilograms using a sling, making it suitable for transporting heavy equipment such as artillery guns, vehicles, and construction materials. This capability is particularly valuable for logistics and supply missions in remote and inaccessible areas, where traditional ground transport is impractical.
          
          The operational history of the Mi-17 in the IAF is extensive and distinguished. It has been a critical asset in numerous military operations, disaster relief efforts, and humanitarian missions. The helicopter's versatility allows it to perform a wide range of tasks, from troop transport and medical evacuation to search and rescue missions and special operations. During natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and landslides, the Mi-17 has been instrumental in delivering aid, rescuing stranded individuals, and providing critical medical support.
          
          One notable deployment of the Mi-17 was during the Kargil conflict in 1999, where it played a crucial role in logistics and troop movement in the high-altitude terrain of the Himalayas. The helicopter's ability to operate effectively at high altitudes was a significant advantage in the challenging mountainous regions of Jammu and Kashmir. Similarly, the Mi-17 has been vital in anti-insurgency operations in various parts of India, providing aerial support and enhancing the mobility of security forces.</p>
